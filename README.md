# MiniSpotify
A mini-player/viewer for Spotify, that gives you the information you want but in a smaller windowed package.

This is just a little application, designed to pack spotify away neatly. It's mostly just for learning some bits, but it is also
a package I've wanted to create for a little while.

Made with C#, using WPF. Also currently is implementing [Johnny Crazy's Spotify API](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET),
but do plan to write my own equivalent instead at some point.
