# About this branch

This branch is to add a button on the main interface so the user can save and unsave the currently playing songs into the Liked Songs library.

It adds the following scopes for the feature to work:
- user-library-read
- user-library-modify

# MiniSpotify
A mini-player/viewer for Spotify, that gives you the information you want but in a smaller windowed package.

This is just a little application, designed to pack spotify away neatly. It's mostly just for learning some bits, but it is also
a package I've wanted to create for a little while.

Made with C#, using WPF. Also currently is implementing [Johnny Crazy's Spotify API](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET),
but do plan to write my own equivalent instead at some point.
